# TurtleIt

## Introduction
TurtleIt has been designed in response a perceived need; a simplified interface for young learners to use Python Turtle in a remotely paired programming environment. The intent is that TurtleIt:
- allows learners on multiple machines to work on the same code file without need to log in
- abstracts from the need for accurate spellings, capitalisaion, brackets, spaces etc
- removes the need to enter/opportunity to accidentally remove library code, imports, etc

## Workflow (students)
1. Use a shortcut to open Google drive folder, select challenge number (incremental) and then team number (assigned by teacher
2. Type in code to instruct turtle
3. Double-click TurtleIt file and enter challenge/team numbers to plot maze and see how the turtle does to get through it
4. Repeat ad-infinitum
